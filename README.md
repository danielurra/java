## Java
In order to be able to `compile and run` Java code in your computer, Java JDK must be installed on your computer<br />
**JDK** stands for "<b>Java Development Kit</b>"<br />
<br/>
Once you have JDK installed on your computer you can navigate to the folder<br/>
where all the executable files are located<br/>
<br/>
<b>Java's Bin folder location</b>
![java-bin-folder](https://github.com/danielurra/java/assets/51704179/4f3bdd3e-75f1-45d1-9259-722647880bb3)</br>
<br/>
The first thing you'll have to do is to add the Java's bin folder path inside the system's PATH<br/>
<br/>
PATH is an "<b>environment variable</b>" that tells the OS where to find executable files<br/>
<br/>
You must use the "<b>set path</b>" CLI command as shown below:<br/>
```
set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin
```
![set-path](https://github.com/danielurra/java/assets/51704179/d1f00084-d495-4ed8-a6a6-799b2ea30620)<br/>
You can echo the variable to see if the new entry is there now
```
echo %PATH%
```

## Java Hello World!
As you can see, even the simple and classic "<b>Hello World</b>" code looks as a little bit</br>
complicated in Java</br>

## Compile then run
We are going to use 2(two) executable files, <b>"javac.exe"</b> when compiling and <b>"java.exe"</b> when running<br/>
<b>java.exe</b> will invoke the java Virtual Machine in the background, totally transparent for us<br/>
<br/>
<b>Before Compilation</b><br />

## Compiling with javac<br />

<br/>
<b>After Compilation</b><br/>
Immediately after the compilation is done, you'll see that another file was created<br />
that file with extension <b>".class"</b> is what in Java is known as <b>"bytecode"</b><br />

## JShell
Those of you who are new to Java programming, could take advantage of "JShell" which is often helpful for trying out the code snippets.<br>
JDK 9 and above include this tool that lets you execute a snippet of Java code instead of writing a full Java program.<br>
* For Beginners -> Practice and Learn the syntax
* For Developers -> Execute part of program in simple way
  
JShell is a `Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop` (**REPL**), which evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered and immediately shows the 
results.<br>
## Why use JShell?
Jshell has reduced all the efforts that are required to run a Java program and test a business logic.<br>
If we donâ€™t use Jshell, creating of Java program involves the following steps.<br>
* Open editor and write program
* Save the program
* Compile the program
* Edit if any compile time error
* Run the program
* Edit if any runtime error
* Repeat the process
  
Jshell does not require above steps. We can evaluate statements, methods and classes, even can write hello program without creating class.<br>
JShell helps you try out code and easily explore options as you develop your program.<br>
## Java version
```bash
java --version
```
![jshell-00](https://github.com/danielurra/java/assets/51704179/d18fbe3a-35ac-4088-a9c7-fca64626d53d)
## Launch JShell
```bash
jshell
```
![jshell-01](https://github.com/danielurra/java/assets/51704179/45345190-7348-4e1d-8361-ad5883d8442f)
## Eexecute your first Java snippet of code
**No semicolons needed**</br>
```bash
System.out.println("Hello JDK 19!")
```
![jshell-02](https://github.com/danielurra/java/assets/51704179/39fbe7de-e7a1-46c3-b2bc-63f6941b2d1c)
## Exit JShell
```bash
/exit
```
![jshell-03](https://github.com/danielurra/java/assets/51704179/0370a258-e7b6-4354-9803-76bab3890759)
## Eclipse IDE

A Package declaration is something needed when running the java Hello World code using Eclipe IDE
![eclipse-ide-hello-world](https://github.com/danielurra/java/assets/51704179/ffc979c5-0060-4ead-80ff-90eb5f0bd7b9)<br/>
## Declare a Variable as Integer and set a value
``` java
package package01;

public class HelloWorld {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
//		Declare and set in one line 
		Integer myfirstvar = 77;
//		 Print the value concatenated (plus sign +) with some random text for better understanding
		System.out.println("My first variable has a value of: " + myfirstvar);
	}
}
```
## See the console
