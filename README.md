## Java
In order to be able to compile and run Java code in your computer, you must install the Java JDK<br />
JDK stands for "<b>Java Development Kit</b>"<br />
<br/>
Once you have JDK installed on your computer you can navigate to the folder<br/>
where all the executable files are located<br/>
<br/>
<b>Java's Bin folder location</b>

The first thing you'll have to do is to add the Java's bin folder path inside the system's PATH<br/>
<br/>
PATH is an "<b>environment variable</b>" that tells the OS where to find executable files<br/>

## Compile then run
We are going to use 2(two) executable files, <b>"javac.exe"</b> when compiling and <b>"java.exe"</b> when running<br/>
<b>java.exe</b> will invoke the java Virtual Machine in the background, totally transparent for us<br/>
<br/>

<b>After Compilation</b><br/>
Immediately after the compilation is done, you'll see that another file was created<br />
that file with extension <b>".class"</b> is what in Java is known as <b>"bytecode"</b><br />
