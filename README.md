## Java Repository
In order to be able to compile and run Java code in your computer, you must install the Java JDK<br />
JDK stands for Java Development Kit<br />
Once you have the Java JDK installed on your computer you can navigate the folder where all the executable files<br/>
are located.<br/>
The first thing you'll have to do is to set the java bin folder as a system PATH, see image below:<br/>

We are going to use 2(two) executable files, <b>"javac.exe"</b> when compiling and <b>"java.exe"</b> when running<br/>
<b>java.exe</b> will invoke the java Virtual Machine in the background, totally transparent for us<br/>

After Compilation<br/>
Immediately after the compilation is done, you'll see that another file was created<br />
that file with extension <b>".class"</b> is what in Java is known as <b>"bytecode"</b><br />
